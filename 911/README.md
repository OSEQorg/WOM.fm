INTRODUCTION
Flooding, scarcity of clean water has been a major issue in Nigeria. It has led to the increase of various health and environmental issues. That is why team G-stars ventured into seeking for answers to the cause and possible solution to this challenge. We started from the root cause which is Climate Changes.

AIM
The aim is to reduce the effect of climate changes and amend the damages caused by it.


WHAT IS CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns,  that is natural elements varying over the decades. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, making us experience unprecedented  rapid warming, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.


RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Climate change affects the social and environmental determinants of health: clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter.

CAUSES OF CLIMATE CHANGE
The largest contributor to global climate change is Burning fossil fuels, which is coal, oil and gas. According to the United Nations fossil fuels account for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 per cent of all carbon dioxide emissions.  Another Example of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change includes carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and forests can also release carbon dioxide. 

Landfills for garbage or refuse are a major source of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main Emitters.

This Greenhouse gas emissions act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures. This leads to global warming and climate change. The world is now warming faster than at any point in recorded history. Warmer temperatures over time are changing weather patterns and disrupting the usual balance of nature. This poses many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.

SIGNS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
1. Global Temperature is rising: The planet's average surface temperature has risen about two degrees Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities. Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.

2. The Ocean is getting warmer: The Ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 100 meters (about 328 feet) of ocean showing warming of more than 0.6 degrees Fahrenheit (0.33 degrees Celsius) since 1969.6 Earth stores 90% of the extra energy in the ocean.

3. Sea Level is rising: Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.

4. Ocean Acidification is increasing: Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30%. This increase is due to humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the ocean. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and 30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades that is 7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year

HOW CLIMATE CHANGE HAS DISRUPTED THE ENVIRONMENT
Sudden fire outbreak: There has been an ever-increasing temperature level over the last few years. Carbon dioxide which is the primary greenhouse gas has contributed to the recent changes in the climate. Before the establishment of industries that make use of carbon as the source of power, the carbon dioxide level has undergone more than 140% increase. The hotter the temperature in some regions, the more prone to wildfires which had led to the loss of lives, damage of properties, barren lands, and so on.

Drought: Climate change affects the soil negatively. Due to the high temperature, the soil water dries up, resulting in breakage of the soil which makes it unfit for farming. With the alarming rate at which the temperature gets hotter, famine is at the doorstep of the world.

Intense rainfall: The change in climate leads to intense rainfall because the warmer air absorbs more water from the water bodies which reduces the soil water. This causes the rainfall to be intense when it pours down.

Poverty and displacement: Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Water scarcity may affect crops.

Loss of species: Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperatures climb. Exacerbated by climate change, the world is losing species at a rate 1,000 times greater than at any other time in recorded human history. One million species are at risk of becoming extinct within the next few decades. Forest fires, extreme weather, and invasive pests and diseases are among many threats related to climate change. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not.


HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change is one of the biggest threats to the health sector because it affects almost everything that is needed for healthy living. Some of its effects are:
Intense heat can lead to a skin infection.

Flooding contaminates the clean water supply source, which leads to other health diseases like when taken.

Climate changes cause a shortage of food supply due to drought or flood which causes malnutrition, low birth weight, anemia, and lower nutrient intakes.

Increase in mortality rate.


HOW CAN WE FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE?
To every problem, there is a solution. Climate change may have affected the earth to a great extent but there are possible solutions that if acted upon can repair the damages climate change has enacted. It will take a long time but the changes will be evident. Some of these possible solutions are:
Spread the word

Encourage your friends, family and co-workers to reduce their carbon pollution. Join a global movement like Eden conserve, which aims to inspire 1 billion people to take practical steps and challenge their leaders to act more boldly on climate. 

Afforestation - Planting of trees.

Afforestation is a way of making nature absorb more carbon. Plants need carbon dioxide to manufacture their foods. The more trees planted around the less the effect of greenhouse gas which contributes to climate change. 

Fight against deforestation
There is a need to protect the available trees because they are important in the fight against climate change. Governments can stop industries from cutting trees in strategic places by making better laws.

Recycle
Recycling products like plastic instead of dumping them on the soil contributes to fighting climate change. Plastics can not decompose, it only litters the environment, damages the soil and contributes to environmental pollution


CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED
Some of the challenges encountered during the hackfest are: 
Lack of response from the NGOs we reached out to.

Personal gain of the NGOs before we can work with them.

Poor supply of electricity slowed down the progress.



AUDIO RECORDING
The audio was recorded and uploaded on the GitHub repository after the content was ready. There are six (6) audios in total.

CREATION OF THE WEBPAGE
The webpage consists of the uploaded audio files and a form for people who are in affected or likely affected regions of areas of climate change to fill. The send button is attached to the team's email address and the mail will be accessed and channeled to the right portal.


CONCLUSION
G-stars aim at reducing the effect of climate change and we have created a solution that can be accessible by all. 
To be able to rectify the damages caused by climate change, all hands need to be on deck. Nobody is left out. The government makes the necessary laws, the public implements them and ensures people around them do the same.
No matter the little input, it all counts when we add ours.
